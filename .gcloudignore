# IMPORTANT: Do NOT ignore config files (we need them in Cloud Build!)
# Comment out or remove these lines to include config:
# !config/config.toml
# !config/firebase-service-account.json

# The ! prefix means "do not ignore" - but gcloud doesn't support it well
# So we just don't list config/ here at all, which means it WILL be included
